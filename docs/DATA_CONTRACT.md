# Minimum Experimental Record

This contract defines the smallest reactor-level contribution that can support an
auditable Biochar–AD analysis. It is an intake gate, not a claim that every valid
file can answer the project's global dose–temperature hypothesis.

## Grain and identity

Each row is **one observation from one physical reactor at one time point**. Never
expand a treatment mean into pseudo-replicates. The combination
`study_id + experiment_id + reactor_id + time_days` must be unique.

Start from `data/templates/reactor_observations.csv` and validate the completed file:

```bash
biochar-ad validate-intake path/to/reactor_observations.csv
```

The command prints a machine-readable JSON report and exits with status 2 when an
error makes ingestion unsafe. Warnings preserve limited datasets while making their
evidence boundary explicit.

## Required fields

| Group | Fields | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | `study_id`, `experiment_id`, `reactor_id`, `treatment_id`, `replicate_id` | Preserve independent experimental units |
| Time/process | `time_days`, `temperature_c` | Locate every measurement in the process |
| Design | `is_control`, `is_inoculum_blank`, `substrate_id`, `inoculum_id`, `material_id` | Separate material, substrate and inoculum effects |
| Dose | `dose_value`, `dose_unit` | Preserve the reported dose without silent conversion |
| Response | `raw_cumulative_methane_ml`, `blank_corrected_methane_ml_g_vs` | Keep source measurement and processed outcome together |
| QC | `qc_include`, `qc_flags` | Exclude transparently without deleting observations |
| Provenance | `data_origin`, `source_record_id` | Trace each row back to a sheet, cell, table or instrument record |

Allowed `dose_unit` values are `g_l`, `g_g_vs`, `pct_ts`, `mg_reactor`, and `none`.
Use `material_id = none` and a zero dose for no-additive controls. Inoculum-only
blanks may leave `blank_corrected_methane_ml_g_vs` empty because they contain no
substrate VS denominator.

## Validation rules and evidence limits

The automated gate rejects missing identifiers, invalid numbers or booleans,
negative time/dose, duplicate observation keys, unsupported dose units, changing
reactor metadata, and included rows without a raw methane measurement.

Empty datasets, infinite numeric values, and missing dose units are also rejected.
The `none` dose unit is allowed only at zero dose. Numeric and boolean values are
compared after parsing: for example, time `1` and `1.0` identify the same observation,
and numeric text is sorted numerically when checking cumulative trajectories.
Validation does not modify the supplied frame or source file.

It warns about missing processed yields, missing non-blank substrate controls,
missing inoculum blanks, unreplicated treatments and decreasing cumulative raw
trajectories. An inoculum-only blank does not replace a substrate control, even
when both have `is_control = true`.

Control and replication checks use only observations with `qc_include = true`.
A reactor with at least one included observation counts once; fully excluded
reactors do not satisfy these checks. Treatments with zero included reactors still
receive the replication warning, and fully excluded experiments receive a
`no_included_observations` warning. Report totals retain all submitted observations,
reactors and experiments, including excluded ones, to preserve the audit trail.
The cumulative-trajectory warning also retains excluded observations for source QC.

These are presence checks, not proof of complete usable trajectories, matched
controls at every condition, or sufficient independent replication. A warning is a
scientific limitation to report, not permission to manufacture missing information.

Passing this gate establishes structural integrity only. Causal mechanism claims,
global dose response, temperature extrapolation and plant-level control still require
appropriate factorial designs and genuinely held-out reactors or studies.
