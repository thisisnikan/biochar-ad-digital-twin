# Experimental data provenance

## Contribution contract

New reactor-level contributions should use
`templates/reactor_observations.csv` and pass the automated intake gate before an
ingestion script or model is added:

```bash
biochar-ad validate-intake data/templates/reactor_observations.csv
```

See `docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md` for field definitions, validation rules and evidence
limits. Existing historical datasets keep their source-faithful schemas; they should
be mapped explicitly rather than silently renamed.

## Kozłowski et al. (2025)

`experimental/kozlowski_2025_bmp.csv` is a tidy, mechanically derived version of the
publisher's XLSX supplement to:

> Kozłowski, M., Papaj, B., Sobieraj, K., Świechowski, K., Kosiorowska, K. &
> Białowiec, A. *The effect of different carbon materials' addition on the
> biomethane production from food waste*. Scientific Reports 15, 18728 (2025).
> https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-02564-0

- Article and supplement license: CC BY 4.0.
- Publisher supplement: `41598_2025_2564_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx`.
- Verified source SHA-256:
  `a5be0c25990acbdd0a6ac14dfa202398e61713fea8496884018e97f1cf87b983`.
- Experiment: triplicate mesophilic (37 °C) batch digestion for 21 days, with food
  waste alone or a 5 g/L carbon-material addition.
- Raw source columns retained: reactor-level cumulative methane volume and the
  corresponding inoculum-control mean.
- Processed response: blank-corrected cumulative methane divided by substrate VS,
  matching the source workbook's calculation.

### Explicit data-quality decisions

The source workbook's derived `Days` column ends at 5.25 while its hourly index and
day label end at 504 hours and day 21. The tidy dataset therefore defines
`time_days = time_hours / 24` and retains the inconsistent source value in
`source_reported_time_days` for auditability.

Torrefaction replicate 2 and pyrolysis replicate 3 are retained but marked
`included_in_benchmark = false`. The publisher workbook excludes these same reactor
signals from its displayed treatment averages, and their raw trajectories are
inconsistent with sibling reactors. No observations are deleted or silently clipped.

Rebuild the CSV from a local or downloaded source workbook:

```bash
python scripts/build_kozlowski_2025_dataset.py
```

The script verifies the source hash before parsing it.

### Complete reactor-observation export

`experimental/kozlowski_2025_reactor_observations.csv.gz` adds all three individual
inoculum-only blank trajectories to the existing twelve substrate reactors. It
contains 7,575 source-linked observations in the minimum intake contract, with
source metadata and correction inputs retained as extra columns. Blanks have no
substrate-normalized yield. The original benchmark file and exclusions are preserved.

The exporter also records a source conflict in the food-waste control's carbon
mass/dose cells. Zero canonical dose follows the established treatment mapping;
the conflicting source values remain visible pending author clarification.

See the [intake report and gap list](../results/intake/README.md) for commands,
field interpretation, validation findings and scientific limitations.

## Valentin & Białowiec (2024)

`experimental/valentin_bialowiec_2024_parameters.csv` transcribes the five dose
conditions and published modified-Gompertz estimates from Table 3 of:

> Valentin, M. T. & Białowiec, A. *Impact of using glucose as a sole carbon
> source to analyze the effect of biochar on the kinetics of biomethane
> production*. Scientific Reports 14, 8656 (2024).
> https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-59313-y

- Article license: CC BY 4.0.
- Experiment: triplicate 37 °C reactors with glucose, wheat-straw biochar
  produced at 900 °C, and doses of 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 g/L.
- Scope: exact table-level cumulative BMP, fit statistics, potential, maximum
  rate, rate constant, and lag; these are published estimates, not raw reactor
  trajectories.
- The article reports 86,400 raw cases but states that those data are available
  from the corresponding author on reasonable request. They are not reconstructed
  or represented here as open raw data.

## Zhang et al. (2022)

`experimental/zhang_2022_biochar_characteristics.csv` contains the five
pyrolysis-temperature biochar descriptors reported in Table 1 and the Raman
`I_D/I_G` values reported in the article text:

> Zhang, C., Yang, R., Sun, M. et al. Wood waste biochar promoted anaerobic
> digestion of food waste: focusing on the characteristics of biochar and
> microbial community analysis. Biochar 4, 62 (2022).
> https://doi.org/10.1007/s42773-022-00187-6

- Article license: CC BY 4.0.
- Experiment: triplicate 37 °C food-waste batch digestion with 10 g/L wood-waste
  biochar prepared at several pyrolysis temperatures and residence times.
- The public table records surface O/C ratio, XPS-derived oxygen-containing bond
  percentages, and Raman `I_D/I_G`; it does not infer missing properties.

On 2026-08-26, Chao Zhang also shared a workbook containing post-processed
treatment means and standard deviations for cumulative methane, pH, and six VFAs.
The methane series are already inoculum-blank corrected. The original triplicate
files are no longer available, so the shared workbook cannot support
replicate-held-out validation or empirical replicate resampling.

The workbook is not redistributed while public-repository permission is pending.
`scripts/build_zhang_2022_dataset.py` verifies the private source hash and builds
ignored long-form methane and process-monitoring tables:

```bash
python scripts/build_zhang_2022_dataset.py --source /path/to/Data.xlsx
```

No pseudo-replicates are generated. Any model fitted to these summary curves must
identify its uncertainty and validation limits explicitly.
